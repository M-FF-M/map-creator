# map-creator

Playing with OSM: the goal is to render high quality OSM maps (to vector graphics) while keeping
the file size low. This is work in progress and will potentially never be finished.

The best existing online converter, in my opinion, is [MyOSMatic](https://print.get-map.org/).
There are two drawbacks however: on the one hand, the file size reaches hundreds of MB very fast -
trying to create a hiking map of a reasonably-sized region results in files of about 1 GB. On the
other hand, there is no way to influence the scale and neither a ruler nor a legend are part of the
final map.
